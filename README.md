Consider a game called "BattleArena" where players control different types of characters and engage in battles. Implement the necessary classes and demonstrate the usage of object-oriented programming concepts, such as encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and composition.

1. Create a base class called "Character" that represents a generic character in the game. It should have attributes such as "Name" (string), "Health" (int), and "Damage" (int). Provide appropriate getter and setter methods to encapsulate these attributes.

2. Implement at least two subclasses derived from the "Character" base class, such as "Warrior" and "Mage". Each subclass should have unique attributes or methods that are specific to that type of character. For example, a warrior may have an additional attribute called "Armor" (int) and a method called "AttackWithSword," while a mage may have an additional attribute called "Mana" (int) and a method called "CastSpell."

3. Create a class called "Battle" that simulates a battle between two characters. The class should have a method called "StartBattle" that takes two instances of the "Character" class as parameters and simulates the battle between them. The battle should continue until one character's health reaches zero. Use appropriate object-oriented design principles to handle the battle mechanics and actions between the characters.

4. Demonstrate polymorphism by creating instances of both the "Warrior" and "Mage" classes and passing them as parameters to the "StartBattle" method. The battle should correctly utilize the specific attributes and methods of each character type.

5. Implement additional features or mechanics to make the game more engaging, such as special abilities, critical hits, or healing potions. These features should utilize object-oriented programming principles effectively.
